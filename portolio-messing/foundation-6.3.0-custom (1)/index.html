        <p>Iâ€™m a Junior Web Developer with a background in Head Office Recruitment, Human Resources and Learning &amp; Development. Most recently working as Digital Recruiter for TOPSHOP TOPMAN, I found myself fascinated by how our e-commerce platform worked
            and the intricacies of the digital world. I was inspired to dive feet first into a career in web development and joined the immersive course at General Assembly. This has given me the opportunity to work across full stack technologies, alongside
            broader web theory and agile working methodologies resulting in several end-to-end projects. I am excited to start a new role within a team where I can work closely with an experienced mentor to both continue to build on my newly acquired
            skills and further grow my love of all things digital.</p>
